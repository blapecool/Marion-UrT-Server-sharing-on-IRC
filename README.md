Marion UrT Server sharing on IRC
================================

You probably heard of she if you know a bit the Urban Terror community. Marion is the bot that I coded to share our private servers via IRC


## Requirements
	* Ruby (> 1.9 at least)
	* cinch ruby gem
	* cinch-identify ruby gem
	* my custom version of urbanterror gem, you can grab it here : https://github.com/blapecool/urbanterror-gem/tree/dev
	* A dedicated server to run the bot and Urban Terror private servers to share


## Setup 
	* Grab the code
	* READ THE CODE
	* Install the requirement
	* Set your settings by edition all files in conf/*
	* run it

## How it works / How to use it ?
Just read the code.
You can also read the topic I made to present the service [here](http://www.urbanterror.info/forums/topic/30605-urban-terror-42-private-server-sharing/) but it will not give admin commands.
